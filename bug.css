The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you use `calc()` with units that can't be directly compared (like `em` and `px`), it may cause unexpected layout issues.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100em - 20px);` might not produce the desired result because the browser struggles to combine `em` and `px` units directly.
