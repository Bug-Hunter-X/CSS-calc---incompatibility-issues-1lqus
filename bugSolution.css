To solve this, make sure to use consistent units within the `calc()` expression.  For example, convert `px` to `em` or vice-versa to ensure compatibility.  Alternatively, if possible restructure your CSS to avoid the need for combining incompatible units.  The following example demonstrates a solution using consistent units (em):

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  width: calc(100% - 2.5em); /* Assuming 20px is roughly equivalent to 2.5em */
}
```
This ensures that the calculation is performed using a consistent unit, leading to a more reliable and predictable layout.
